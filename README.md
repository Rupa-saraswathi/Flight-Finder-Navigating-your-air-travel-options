# ✈️ FlightFinder – Navigating Your Air Travel Options

FlightFinder is a full-stack **Flight Booking Web Application** developed using the **MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js)**.  
The application provides a smooth and user-friendly platform for users to search, book, and manage flight tickets, while admins can manage flights and monitor bookings.

This project was developed as part of the **SmartBridge Internship Program** to gain real-world experience in full-stack web development.

## 📌 Project Description

FlightFinder simplifies the flight booking process by allowing users to easily search for flights based on their preferences such as source, destination, date, and travel class.  
Users can book flights, view booking history, and cancel bookings.  
Admins have access to manage flights, update flight details, and monitor all user bookings.

The project follows a clean **frontend–backend separation** with REST APIs and a NoSQL database.
